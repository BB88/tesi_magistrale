The watermarking algorithm has been implemented in C++ programming language. The following libraries and codes has been used:
\begin{itemize}
\item rectify-quasi-euclidean\_20140626 \cite{}: to compute disparity range;
\item kz2\_r1.0 \cite{}, to compute disparity map;
\item  \cite{}, to compute quality measures in \cite{};
\item ffmpeg-2.7.2, to compress video sequence.
\end{itemize}

Matlab code viewSynthCode \cite{} has been used to compute intermediate frames for view synthesis experiments.
