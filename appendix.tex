The watermarking algorithm has been implemented in C++ programming language. The following libraries and codes has been used:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{rectify-quasi-euclidean\_20140626} \cite{rqe}: to compute disparity range;
\item \texttt{kz2\_r1.0} \cite{KZ}, to compute disparity map;
\item \texttt{ffmpeg-2.7.2} \cite{ffmpeg}, to compress video sequence;
\item \texttt{libconfig} \cite{libcfg}, to set and save the watermark parameters.
\end{itemize}

Matlab code \texttt{viewSynthCode} \cite{VS} has been used to compute intermediate frames for view synthesis experiments.
