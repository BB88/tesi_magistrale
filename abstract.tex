Nowdays stereoscopic videos play an important role in many applications: from medical diagnosis and endoscopic surgery to fault detection in manufactory industry, army and arts, in people tracking and mobile robotics navigation as, naturally, in the film industry with 3D movie release.\\
The huge increase of distribution systems of this content leads to the increase of concerns over content copyright protection: in this thesis a disparity-coherent watermarking technique has been presented to protect stereoscopic video contents.\\
The algorithm belongs to view-based methods and operates in both frequency and spatial domain in a diparity-coherent way, namely, a physical point of the captured scene always carries the same watermark sample regardless of where it appears in the left and right views.\\
This kind of techniques has been proved to yield less visual discomfort and to be robust against view synthesis attacks, as shown by the experiments conducted on the implemented algorithm.
